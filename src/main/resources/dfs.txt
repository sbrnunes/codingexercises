Iterative

dfs(node start) {
    stack<node> s; //LIFO

    s.push(start);

    while (s.empty() == false) {
        top = s.top();
        s.pop();

        if (top is not marked as visited) {
            check for termination condition (have we reached the node we want to?)

            mark top as visited;
            add all of top's neighbors to the stack.
        }
    }
}


Recursive

dfs(node current) {
    mark current as visited;
    visit all of current's unvisited neighbors by calling dfs(neighbor)
}

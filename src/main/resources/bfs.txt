    queue<node> s; //FIFO
    s.push(start);

    mark start as visited

    while (s.empty() == false) {
        top = s.front();
        s.pop();

        check for termination condition (have we reached the node we want to?)

        add all of top's unvisited neighbors to the queue
        mark all of top's unvisited neighbors as visited
    }
